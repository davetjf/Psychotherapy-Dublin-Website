# Stream 1 Front End Development Project 
 
## Overview

This is a front end development project. The goal is to re-develop a website for a Psychotherapy Clinic using new images from the offices. The project is to show case the offices and also make the website interactive for the end user. Another goal of the website is to inform potantial clients about Psychoanalysis, give information about the clinic itself, and progress to call the clinic or book a session.
